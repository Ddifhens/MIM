MIM, or "my individual manual" serves just as the name says, to aggregate and condense a lot of scattared information about several topics, usually relating to linux, arch, ricing etc.
this manual is configured to be completely functional with obsidian, ssince that is what i use. And it will always work better as such, due to the great link function.
so far it is in no way complete and its contributed to on a "i need to know, i figured it out, let me write so i dont forget" basis 



loose todo: 

moved to obsidian tags system, wil need to create ways in which to update the MIM more easily since there is no concise file for all MIM entries to live in
